# Network Integrated Motion Sensor 
This project is part of a requirement of completion for ECE 2305 - Introduction to Communications and Networks at Worcester Polytechnic Institute. The project involves a magnetic door sensor connected to a Raspberry Pi to detect a person entering the room, and then reporting this information over the internet to a group of users via a Discord Bot Application. 

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites


### Installing

## Additional Notes


## Built With
* [RPi.GPIO Python Library](https://sourceforge.net/p/raspberry-gpio-python/wiki/Home/)
  A method for controlling the Generic-Purpose Input/Output (GPIO) pins on the Raspberry Pi in order to retrive sensor input
* [Eclipse Paho MQTT Python Library](https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/)
  Python implementation of the MQTT transfer protocol, allowing a bi-directional publisher/subscriber network between the Raspberry Pi and other devices.
* [Discord Developer API](https://discordapp.com/developers/docs)
  The Discord API which allows for custom programs to interface with Discord Chat Application
* [discord.py](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
  A Python-based wrapper for the Discord API. Allows for development of Python programs to be used as Discord Applications
